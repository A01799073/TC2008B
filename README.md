# TC2008B

Course material for the Multi-agents and computer graphics course. By the end of the course, you will create a traffic simulation, where each car is an individual agent that has to traverse a city with other cars:

*Sample simulation created by Mateo Herrera, and Gerardo Guti√©rrez.* 

The repository contains the following material:

- [Documents](Documents/): Has presentations, and cheat sheets.
- [Agents Visualization](AgentsVisualization/Readme.md): This is a webGL project that is used to visualize the random agents model using HTML instead of mesa.
- [Mesa examples](mesaExamples/Readme.md): The basic mesa examples. Included the random model, forest fire, and the city model.

# Setup instructions

- Install python. I strongly recommend using a custom venv or conda environment.
    - I recommend [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) over [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
    - There is a [cheat sheet](Documents/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) in the repo with all the conda commands.
    - Either create a new environment with python (``` conda create --name agents python ```), or use the provided environment file (``` conda env create -f agents_environment.yml```)
- If you are using the python version on your sistem, or you created a new environment using venv, install the following packages:
    - mesa: ```pip install mesa```
    - flask: ```pip install flask```
- By this moment, the environment will have all the packages needed for the projects and examples to run.
